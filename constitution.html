			<h1>Hack Club Constitution</h1>

			<h3>Article I – Name</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>The Name of the organization shall be Hack Club of “San Leandro High School”(SLHS).</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Article II - purpose/Mission/values</h3>
			<ol>
			  <li>This organization shall have its purpose, to explore computer science, to attend hackathons, to teach computer programming, to promote computer science.</li>
			  <li>Hack Club shall abide by HackEDU Mission & Values</li>
			  <ol>  
				<li>Empower Others: Make heroes. Unleash the greatness of others, enable them to do things they never thought they could do, inside and outside of Hack Club. This is the core of what Hack Club is all about.<li>
				<li>Everyone's just drawing the owl: There’s no instruction book - it’s ours to draw. Figure out, ship it, and iterate</li>
				<li>Create Safety: Your job is to create a safe atmosphere for others where they can feel comfortable and can free to be themselves. This means:
				  <ul>
					<li>No feigning surprise</li>
					<li>No making fun of someone for not knowing something</li>
					<li>No well-actually's</li>
					<li>No subtle -isms</li>
					<li>No making fun of someone for making mistakes</li>
					<li>Never say that something is a stupid question, just answer in the most direct way possible or point them to a resource like google to help answer it in a very respectful way and explain why you are pointing them to google.</li>
					<li>No making people feel bad for not following our family values.</li>
					<li>Be humble</li>
				  </ul>
				</li>
				<li>Do Hard Things: Your brain is like a muscle. You know when you've gotten a good workout when your brain is tired, sore, and confused. If our ambitions aren't terrifying, we aren't pushing ourselves enough. Think scary big. Volunteer for impossible situations. Get shit done.
				</li>
				<li>Fail Hard, Fail Often: If we're not failing enough, it means that we're not working at the maximum level of difficulty.
			Celebrate Failures & Small Wins: Also when someone fails, we should celebrate this to encourage more of this behavior. This may seem like overkill, but failure in most places, especially is a very venomous feeling that very often can make people feel terrible. Also small wins are celebrated as well because on the trek to mount doom, it is a long and windy road filled with obstacles. It feels good to celebrate when thing are going right helping you eventually to get to the peak of mount doom.
				</li>
				<li>Ship it: If something isn't usable by people, we can't tell how good it is. Also the longer you wait to ship it, the less likely it is that you will.
				</li>
				<li>Every frame matters: Think holistically. Execute with obsession to detail. Success is measured by pride, not credit.
				</li>
				<li>Create fun and amplify absurdity: Life's too short to take yourself too serious. We all end up in the same place anyway so why not have fun throughout the journey? We think that fun is best created when we are free to be ourselves and get a little absurd. You can tell when fun is happening when people are comfortable doing absurd things together.
				</li>
				<li>Be open, be transparent: We believe that everything we do should be clear to others. That's why all of our "internal" chat is public and all of our resources are under the GNU public licence or MIT licence on Github. Our goal is to have everything that we do as free and usable by others as possible.
				</li>
				<li>Contribute to the community: Whether it's helping other people at your club get something done, helping hackEDU, contributing to open source, etc. it's important to help out others in your own communities and larger communities as well.
				</li>
				<li>Communicate directly to build trust and take feedback well: A lot of times, and especially even when you're trying to be nice to avoid a subject of contention, the other person cannot understand the point that we're trying to convey. The longer these wounds stay festering, the worse that they get. On the other end, learn to take feedback in stride because it's really the only way to iterate and improve ourselves.
				</li>
				<li>Be A Welcoming Host and Build Family Spirit: The experience of newcomers will dictate the success of any organization. Moreover the best communities to be a part of are the ones that are friendly, warm, and and exciting.
				</li>
				<li>Always Learning: Constantly try to get better yourself, you may think you're ahead but that's just on your relative scale. Change your scale.
				</li>
				<li>Incessantly discover and optimize for what what excites you: Life's too short to work on things that don't excite you or that you don't care about. However, a big part of doing what excites you is discovering what it is. Everyone starts out not knowing and the best way to find out is to try a bunch of things that you think you may be curious about. Once you find something, try to get more depth in it. Don't be lame and just do the things that are the default, the ones that just happen to be thrown at you. Just because everyone else is doing it doesn't mean it's the best for you.
				</li>
				<li>Don't beat yourself up: It can be very easy to see people who are better than us and say to ourselves, "I should be like that already, what's wrong with me?". This doesn't help anything: it makes you feel sad and therefore less likely to be able to become more like what you want to be. Instead, when you look at others, consider trying using them as an inspiration, not a rival: "Wow, they're so legit, if they can do it, I can too!" You can ask them for advice and perhaps they can help guide you on that path. This would not be possible if you beat yourself not being as good as that other person.
				</li>
				<li>Start with why: So often we don't as the question, "why" are we doing this. Or even if we are, we don't ask deeply enough. For example, in many engineering schools, everyone always asks the questions with "how" or "what" like who do we make this run faster or "what" technology should we use. Sometimes, someone asks the question, "why" are we doing this. Perhaps the answer they get is to make some process more efficient. However, the next why is even more important: "Why are we making it more efficient". Perhaps the answer is to that we can make the company more money. And then we would have to ask "Why do we care about that?" Maybe we find out that we don't and then we can begin to see that we don't care about this problem very much and maybe it's not worth our time solving. Perhaps we realize how important this really is to us and we redouble our effort.
				</li>
				<li>Champion the Mission Everyday: So we can write these manifestos or have these mission statements that no one really cares about or practices. This is not one of them. We hold ourselves to a high standards to uphold these values that matter to us a lot and live, breathe, and actively practice them each day. If we're not up to standard on it, it is our job to keep on deliberately practicing them.
				</li>
				<li>Don't be afraid to do anything, ever, See both sides, debate: See both sides of every argument and don't hesitate to debate or question the norm.
				</li>
